# Bexio API Client for Elixir

This is a simple client for the API described at <https://docs.bexio.com/>. It will support all functionality while also replacing enums with atoms and
making the structs more useful in elixir.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `bexio_api_client` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bexio_api_client, "~> 0.8.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Requirements:

The API uses [Req](https://github.com/wojtekmach/req/tree/v0.5.0) for the client access to also handle the exponential back-off required in the documentation.


## Documentation 

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/) 
and can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/bexio_api_client>.

## Building a release

1. Update the versions in README.md, and mix.exs
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md
3. (optional, recommended) Run `mix test` and `mix dialyzer`
5. Create a tag for the new version.
6. Push it, github actions will do the release.
